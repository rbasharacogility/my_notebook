# L2 - Welcome
What are Github actions? → workflow automation service for many processes and actions

2 main areas most benefit from automation:

**(Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) CI/CD, or Code deployment →**

_Continuous integration_ integrates new code into existing code bases (Build, test, and merge). 

_Continuous delivery_ is done after integration. New app or package versions are published automatically. 

> Example: publishing a new version of a website after changes have been made to the code. 

# L3 - Git, Github, and Github Actions
## What is Git?
* Free version control system
* Installable on any machine
* Works with any source code / text (language agnostic) 
* Snapshots (commits) → Saves code 
* Work simultaneously with others with “Branches”
* Move between branches with “Checkout”

Control source, rollback to old versions, dev new features without breaking existing code. 

## What is Github?
The company that manages repository and cloud services. 

Repository = bucket

1. Local repository
2. Cloud repository

You make changes locally, push to cloud. You pull from the cloud when needed.
