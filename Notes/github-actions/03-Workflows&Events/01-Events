# Workflow and Events
Event definitions offer complex conditions for building github actions. 
## Available Events
Most available events are workflow (`push`, `pull_request`, `create`, `fork`, etc.) related, but [many others exist](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

> Remember, multiple triggers are possible. 
## Activity Types
Activity types determine when an action is performed, and uses the `on:` designation. For example, executing a workflow when a pull request is opened (as opposed to closed or any other state). 

Syntax looks like:

``
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
``
## Event Filters
Filters give greater control of event configurations, such as activity types (which version, or which type of event occurs) or filters (filter based on an occurrence/conditional logic).
