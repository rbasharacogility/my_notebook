## Getting Started with Git
Git is a core component to using Github and Github Actions. First, check that it is installed on your system.

1. From the [Git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads), follow the instructions to download and install git. 
2. Open your computer's terminal. 
3. Type `git` into the console and press the ENTER key. A list of commands appears if git has been successfully installed. 

If any errors are noted in the terminal:

1. Repeat any skipped or ommitted instructions from the installation steps. 
2. Restart your computer.

This can be done via:

`git config --global user.name "your-username"`
